## <ins>Description<ins/>
Horiseon, a marketing agency, wants a codebase that follows accessibilty standards, so that their site is optimized for search engines. Horiseon has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

During this task, I made sure that all links were functioning correctly. Also, I reworked the CSS to enhance efficiency by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them according to the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each element or section of the page.
